Denver Meeting 1/5/18
* layout changes
    * overview of new layout
    * field sizing and zooming
    * what to do with palettes for add steps and draw paths
        * easiest to hardest...
            * leave them floating
            * put the button palette in the sidebar (too busy? constant back and forth?)
            * change approach to add steps and draw paths
                * add steps: use mouse based approach, clicking in quadrant/direction you want to go
                    * not too hard a change.
                    * more space efficient, less "busy"
                    * maybe not quite as obvious how it works
                    * still need buttons for MT, halt, delete.
                * draw paths: make it similar to old software. click leader (or path) to activate
                    * faster, fewer button clicks. 
                    * can change direction "in place", rather than having to place turn "in the path"
                    * big change. will take some time.
                    * important to allow multiple active file paths, so you can see context
* field logo -- too distracting? fade it on mouseover, fade it always, fade it on contact, allow user to turn off
* questions
    * oblique countermarches? is it correct?
    * how do you delete/edit/change things in pyware? eg, if you wanted to change things in the middle
* concerns
    * middle-of-drill editing. no clear direction yet.
    * user management, sign up, payment.  Stripe.
    * pinwheels. not too worried about this, but need to get started.
    * other things i'd like to work on: 
        * step-two tool. 
        * mirroring.
    * Pyware. are some of our features too close? (despite being independent?)
