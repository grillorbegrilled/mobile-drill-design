        <h2>Precision: Drill Writing Software for Military Bands</h2>
        <p>For generations we have tirelessly tried new ways to write our drills. Precision was 
            created by NAMMB and was specifically designed for the unique challenges and 
            characteristics of military-style marching.
        </p>
        <p>
            Precision allows you to interactively build and visualize your drill, experiment with 
            new ideas, and optionally share it with colleagues.  Your drills are saved in the cloud and 
            are accessible on any device, anytime, anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the features supported by Precision are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>6-to-5 and 8-to-5</li>
            <li>Standard actions like countermarches, flanks, wraps and to-the-rears</li>
            <li>Obliques</li>
            <li>Pinwheels &amp; gate swings</li>
            <li>Drag steps, left/right/about faces</li>
            <li>Follow-the-leader and file recognition</li>
            <li>Multi-level undo</li>
            <li>Set the drill to music</li>
            <li>Upload a personal library of marches.</li>
            <li>Just want to use the first strain of march? No problem. Create a "clip" and easily re-use it in future drills.</li>
            <li>Share drills with other Precision users, if you choose</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
