#### Version 0.3.3

**NEW**: A **Release Notes** dialog describing the latest changes will be shown *the first time a user logs in after a new update is released*.  Release notes can also be accessed from the *Help* menu.

**NEW**: There is a new **Maneuvers** menu on the sidebar that can be used to add common maneuvers.  Currently, *Countermarch*, *Illinois*, and *Texas Turn* are available, with more on the way.

  * Projected paths (*footprints*) are shown for the marchers prior to saving the maneuver, to help visualize where turns will occur.
  * Some maneuvers have options that can be changed.  For example, you can specify the direction of a Texas Turn, or delay files and ranks in a Countermarch.
  * Maneuvers are added to the selected block. The block may still be in the middle of a countermarch or other formation, as long as the file leaders have completed their turns.  For example, you could start an Illinois before the full band has completed a Countermarch.
  * Non-block selections may yield unexpected results.
  * You can use **Undo** and **Redo** to remove or re-add a maneuver.

**FIX**: Sped up **chart printing** by about 50%.  It still takes about 1.5 seconds per chart to prouce the PDF. More improvements are in the works.

**FIX**: **Unhide Marchers** keyboard shortcut on Windows and Chromebooks (Ctrl+Shift+H) was not working.  Cmd+Shift+H can be used on Macs.
