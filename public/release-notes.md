**NEW**: The **Choose Music** dialog now has two tabs:  **My Music** and **NAMMB Music**.  Music that you have uploaded, as well as any clips that you have saved, will be found under My Music.  

Music in the **NAMMB Music** library can be used by all users.  Only the administrator can add music to the NAMMB library.  However, users can create clips from music in the NAMMB library and save them to their personal library.

#### Version 0.3.10 - 8/27/18

**NEW**: Show an instruments legend when printing charts in color.

**FIX**: Delete Track on right-click menu was not working.  Fixed.

**FIX**: Added a scrollbar to the bookmarks menu.  When there were a lot of bookmarks, the menu was sometimes too large to fit on screen.

**FIX**: Added a note about pop-up blockers on the Print Charts dialog box.  Pop-up blockers may prevent the application from opening the chart in a new browser tab. You may need to add an exception to your pop-up blocker, disable it, or hold the Ctrl key to bypass it when printing charts.

**NEW**: You can now **Undo** actions added via the Paths tool. 

**FIX**: Music is now sorted alphabetically.

**FIX**: Charts were showing forecasted paths even when "Counts to forecast" was zero.  This is now fixed.

**FIX**: The Path tool was not working in Block mode.  This is fixed.

**FIX**: More accurate sizing and placement of the yard line numbers.  This may need more tweaking.

**FIX**: Using the space bar to tap out counts in audio dialog was causing drill to start playing in the background.  Fixed.
